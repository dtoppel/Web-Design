  <h1>Dennis Toppel: Background and Ambitions</h1>
  <p>My name is Dennis Toppel, and I current attend the Illinois Institute of Technology. For most of my life, computers and digital technology have played a huge part in my life. I've become increasingly interested with anything related to the field the older I get. It's personally a majoy passion of mine to work into the field, using the skills I learn along the way to create things that I've always dreamed of making a reality. I've always wanted to create a web page of my own, so I can have a place to display the things I've worked on and put them together in a digital portfolio.</p>
  <p>The main interests I have in the digital field would probably have to be video games. I've grown up playing all different kinda of games on all different systems. It always fascinated me when someone was able to transport me into a completely different world. I frequently enjoy movies with a good plot, and video games are able to give a similar experience displayed in a more interactive way, and over a longer period of time. I hope to become a successful game designer, and that I'ss be able to take any digital media skills that I learned to further that career in any way that I can.</p>
