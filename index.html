  <h1>Dennis Toppel: Background and Ambitions</h1>
  <p>My name is Dennis Toppel, and I current attend the Illinois Institute of Technology. For most of my life, computers and digital technology have played a huge part in my life. I've become increasingly interested with anything related to the field the older I get. It's personally a major passion of mine to work into the field, using the skills I learn along the way to create things that I've always dreamed of making a reality. I've always wanted to create a web page of my own, so I can have a place to display the things I've worked on and put them together in a digital portfolio.</p>
  <p>The main interests I have in the digital field would probably have to be video games. I've grown up playing all different kinda of games on all different systems. It always fascinated me when someone was able to transport me into a completely different world. I frequently enjoy movies with a good plot, and video games are able to give a similar experience displayed in a more interactive way, and over a longer period of time. I hope to become a successful game designer, and that I'll be able to take any digital media skills that I learned to further that career in any way that I can.</p>
  <p>I hope that this class can effectively teach me how to incorporate web design into whatever I may want to do in my life. I know how important a good website is for virtually every kind of company one can be a part of, so having a skill in being able to make a website on my own is something that's very important to me. In a perfect scenario, where I'm able to follow and fulfill my dream of being a professional game designer, and am able to do so in a self founded company, I see knowledge of web design as extremely important. If I want to be able to show other people what I can do, and sell them on the idea what what I do is good and interesting, I need to be able to do so in an easy and efficient way. If I can't do that, then the things that I do may never get noticed in the way I want them to be.</p>
  <p>Overall, I hope my background experience will prove to be complimentary to the skills that I learn in this class. I hope to be able to integrate these skills into the other skillset that I have, furthering whatever goals I've set for myself in my life. I want to be able to utilize unique and useful tools that can help me better organize my work, and better use the technology that I use every day. By the end of this course, I will have hopefully achieved all of this, and will be able to move forwards towards a successful career of my choice.</p>
